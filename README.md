Reinforcement Learning Applied by Pytorch.



> Temporal Difference Based RL Methods
* For push box game, you should config your gym environment, then run the following commands.
```bash
cd temporal_difference
cd push_box_game

python main.py
```

* For the maze game, just run the following commands.
```bash
cd temporal_difference
cd morvan_maze_game

python QLearning.py
python Sarsa.py
```

> Value Function Approximate
```bash
cd value_functoin_approximate
cd DQN
python DQN_Maze_Env.py
```
